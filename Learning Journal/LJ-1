Journal URL: https://github.com/ushnish2001/SOEN6841-SPM

Week 1: January 18 - January 27

Date: January 20th

Key Concepts:

Studied Week 1 and Week 2 from the PPT slides shared in the class. Grasped basic idea of what Project Management (PM) is 
and steps followed to execute a successful product or a service. 

Following subpoints describes both the slides in brief :

■ The first slide introduces about what PM is, what it consists of and it’s various phases which are mainly INITIATION, PLANNING, 
MONITORING & CONTROL, CLOSURE.
■ Latter part of the 1st presentation highlights the various steps at INITIATION, DEVELOPMENT and IMPLEMENTATION.
■ The second slides describes Project Initiation in 3 sub-parts : CHARTER, SCOPE, OBJECTIVE, FINANCES & SCHEDULE .
■ Also emphasize how the schedule must meet the FUNCTIONAL REQUIREMENTS of the project, the man-power required to execute, 
BUDGET ESTIMATES and setting GOALS & OBJECTIVES.

Application in Real Projects:
■ Initiation Phase: Charter, Scope, Objective, Finances, and Schedule: In the real world, having a well-defined project charter is crucial. 
It sets the tone for the entire project, clearly outlining the project's purpose, objectives, scope, and financial considerations. 
The scope ensures that the project team and stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the project will deliver. 
Clear objectives help in setting expectations, and managing finances and schedules is essential for project success.
■ Development and Implementation: 
  Functional Requirements: Ensuring that the schedule meets the functional requirements is vital for delivering a product or service 
  that aligns with the client or end-user needs. 
  Manpower and Budget Estimates: Accurate estimation of manpower and budget requirements helps in resource allocation and financial planning. 
  It prevents overcommitting resources or underestimating costs.

Challenges : 
■ Scope Creep: Changes in scope during the project can lead to increased costs and timelines. It's important to manage and control scope 
changes effectively to avoid scope creep.
■ Resource Constraints: In the real world, there might be challenges in acquiring the right talent or resources within the planned budget 
and schedule.
■ Uncertainty and Risks: The dynamic nature of projects can introduce uncertainties and risks. Identifying, assessing, and managing risks 
is crucial to avoid potential issues that could derail the project.

Benefits : 
■ Improved Project Control: Following the PM phases provides a structured approach, ensuring better control over project activities and 
resources.
■ Enhanced Communication: Clearly defined charters, objectives, and scopes facilitate better communication among team members and 
stakeholders, reducing misunderstandings.
■ Increased Project Success Rates: Adhering to project management principles increases the likelihood of delivering projects on time, 
within scope, and within budget, contributing to overall project success.
■ Effective Resource Allocation: Proper planning helps in identifying resource needs and allocating them efficiently, 
leading to optimal resource utilization.

Peer Interactions:
Had a group discussion on the project topic. Researched a bit about what the topic is, its basic functions and how its implemented 
in real-world scenarios

Challenges Faced:
Our main challenge was scheduling of timeframe. We were having difficulties in scheduling the time at what time we should complete a 
particular milestone and be ahead of the deadlines well in advance.

Personal development activities:
Read the Project Management Book to get an in-depth highlights of the introduction and the author’s perspective

Goals for the Next Week:
Understanding better scheduling and learn about the Cost effective techniques while keeping the deadlines intact

Week 2: January 28 - February 3

Date: February 4

Key Concepts Learned:
Week 2 covers on Risk Management. Learnt the definition of a risk, types of risks, how it impacts a project and minimizing strategies 
to maintain the smooth flow of the project. Also learnt the how a risk is assessed on 4 categories : IDENTIFICATION, PRIORITIZATION,
ANALYSIS, MITIGATION
Also learnt how a risk is controlled in 3 ways : PLANNING, RESOLUTION, MONTIORING and what are the various techniques of planning 
potential risks : ACCEPTANCE, AVOIDANCE, RISK TRANSFER, MITIGATION
Calculated the risk reduction leverage(RRL) once a risk is mitigated with respect to original risk and calculate the percentage.

Collaborative Learning:
Had a collaborative discussion on the risk assessment and potential risks that might occur in our project development. 
Understood each one’s take on the topic and brainstormed ideas to form a collective solution.

Further Research/Readings:
Researched in depth and watched videos online on the web about the web and learnt the project manager’s perspective how they tackle 
various types of risk.

Adjustments to Goals:
Learn about configuration management and try to find appropriate softwares to implement in our project.
